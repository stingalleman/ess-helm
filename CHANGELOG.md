# ESS Community Helm Chart 26.1.2 (2026-01-27)

## Added

- Add support for configuring `internalTrafficPolicy` for services behind ingresses. (#999)
- Add support for configuring `externalTrafficPolicy` for `NodePort` and `LoadBalancer` services behind ingresses. (#1000)
- Add support for configuring `externalTrafficPolicy` to `exposedServices`. (#1001)
- Add support for configuring `internalTrafficPolicy` to `exposedServices`. (#1001)
- Add support to customize `nodePort` of exposed services.

  `nodePort` property of `exposedServices.*` is now a string template taking two parameters:
  - `context`: The exposed service values context `*.exposedServices.<svc>`
  - `root` : The helm $ root values context

  On Matrix RTC values, the `nodePort` template defaults to `{{ .context.port }}` so that the `nodePort`
  is the same as `port`. Setting the template to an empty string will skip setting `nodePort`
  on the service.

  (#1002)
- Add support for configuring `externalIPs` of exposed services. (#1006)
- Add support for configuring annotations of Ingress services. (#1007)
- Add support for configuring `externalIPs` of Ingress services. (#1007)

- Build services schema using a common service.json file. (#1003)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 26.1.1 (2026-01-22)

## Removed / Breaking Changes

- Move Synapse's Redis to a top-level shared component that can be used by multiple components of the chart.

  There is no impact when using the default values, but if you have customised values under the `synapse.redis` key, you will need to update them to be under the new top-level `redis` redis. (#972)

# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.12.2 (2025-12-19)

## Security

- Fix critical security issue tracked as `ELEMENTSEC-2025-1670`.

  This release is a critical security update to address an issue affecting all versions of ESS Community and ESS Pro. ESS Classic and other Synapse-based deployments are not affected.

  The issue only has an impact when federation APIs are exposed to an untrusted network. Deployments that are not currently federating, or that only federate in a closed, trusted federation, are not impacted. These deployments should not enable public federation without first applying this update.

  We advise you to apply the update as quickly as possible. (#943)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.12.1 (2025-12-12)

## Removed / Breaking Changes

  Full Changelogs:
  - [v1.144.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.144.0)

  (#915)
- Upgrade Matrix Authentication Service to v1.8.0.

  Highlights:
  - Add more options to deal with localpart conflicts on upstream OAuth 2.0 login.

  Full Changelogs:
  - [v1.8.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v1.8.0)

  (#916)
- Support configuring IPv4-only, IPv6-only or Dual-Stack component binds by configuring `networking.ipFamily`.

  Defaults to `dual-stack` but if you are in a cluster where IPv6 support is either disabled at boot or compiled out you may need to set this to `ipv4` (#921)
- Allow Synapse and Matrix Authentication Service to receive traffic over IPv6. (#921)
- Removed some unused code from the `initSecrets` generation container.

  (#932)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.12.0 (2025-12-04)

## Removed / Breaking Changes

- Remove `imagePullSecrets` in favour of `image.pullSecrets`.

  As of 25.10.1 `imagePullSecrets` was deprecated in favour of `image.pullSecrets`.
  It has now been removed and attempting to use `imagePullSecrets` will trigger a schema
  validation error. (#901)
- Remove the ability to set `rtc.{use_external_ip,node_ip}` via `matrixRTC.sfu.additional` in favour of `matrixRTC.sfu.{useStunToDiscoverPublicIP,manualIP}`.

  As of 25.9.1 `matrixRTC.sfu.{useStunToDiscoverPublicIP,manualIP}` were introduced to provide direct values for these settings. Attempting to set
  these via `matrixRTC.sfu.additional` will result in your values being ignored. (#901)

## Changed

- Upgrade Element Web to v1.12.6.

  Highlights:
  - Remove mentions from forwarded messages.
  - Improve aria attributes on the emoji picker.
  - Support using Element Call for voice calls in DMs.

  (#865, #903, #918)
- Remove hard-coded `podAntiAffinity` for `Deployments` that had set `replicas > 2`. (#867)
- Support `topologySpreadConstraints` on all workloads, not just select ones. (#867)
- Set a soft, default `topologySpreadConstraints` for all workloads.

  The can be removed by setting `topologySpreadConstraints` to `[]` at the top-level or
  overridden on a per-component basis by setting that component's `topologySpreadConstraints`. (#867)
- Unify management of `StatefulSet.spec` along with `Deployment.spec`. (#872)
- Upgrade Synapse to v1.143.0.

  Highlights:
  - Update MSC4140 delayed event support, for separate endpoints.

  Full Changelogs:
  - [v1.143.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.143.0)

  (#876)
- Upgrade Matrix Authentication Service to v1.7.0.

  Highlights:
  - Interactively help users choosing a username.

  Full Changelogs:
  - [v1.7.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v1.7.0)

  (#878)
- Change Element Web and MatrixRTC SFU `Ingresses` to target `Service` port names rather than numbers. (#879)
- Harmonise the hook weights and reduce the number of distinct hook weight values.

  This should speed up installs and upgrades as now there are only 2 distinct pre-install/pre-upgrade hook weights. (#880)
- Better handle the only worker-capable delayed-events endpoint. (#889)
- Remove explicit configuration of HAProxy `maxconn` at the global and backend level.

  This improves the compatibility with microk8s clusters that don't raise `ulimits` by default. (#890)

- Change `ipFamilyPolicy` to `PreferDualStack` for all services to expose them over dual-stack where possible. (#907)
- Change Matrix Authentication Service deployment `maxSurge` to 0.

  We have seen migrations race conditions happening during Matrix Authentication Service pods
  rollout. This sets `maxSurge` to 0 to try to make sure only 1 pod at a time runs the
  migration process. (#910, #914)

## Fixed

- Change Postgres `emptyDirs` to be memory backed. (#894)
- Ensure Postgres is fully setup before marking as available or live. (#897)

- CI: validate that all `emptyDirs` are memory backed. (#894)
- CI: Make sure `init-secrets` job is not created when no secrets needs to be generated. (#896)
- CI: Enhance manifests caching in manifests pytest runs. (#899)
- CI: Make cached manifests immutable to avoid issues where they might be mutated during test runs, causing races. (#899)
- CI: stop flakes in `test_pods_monitored`. (#902)
- CI: fix image verifications step failing on PRs on forks. (#909)
- CI: adjust expected status codes to retry on the upgrade integration tests. (#913)

  Previously, whenever elementWeb was enabled, the url property was silently ignored instead of, as expected, taking precedence. (#819)
- Fix a Matrix compatible JSON response not being correctly sent when a Synapse backend is down. (#829)

## Documentation

- Values Fragments: Make `serverName` unique to 1 fragment. (#806)
- Matrix RTC: Document the SFU `CrashLoopBackOff` issue. (#825)

## Internal

- CI: New implementation of the configuration consistency checks. (#817, #831, #832, #833)
- CI: check that `matrix-tools` containers only ever set `args` and not `command`. (#820)
- CI: check that all changed files have copyright notices for the new Element legal entity. (#822)
- Update SPDX check script to handle multiple Copyright headers. (#822, #835)
- Allow cloning of the source repository on Windows. (#827)

- CI: test that all multi-line config files end up in cluster with a trailing newline. (#829)
- CI: adapt integration test cluster creation for latest pytest-kubernetes. (#841)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.10.2 (2025-10-16)

## Security

- Update Matrix Authentication Service to v1.4.1.

  This is a security release which includes a fix for [CVE-2025-62425](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62425) / [GHSA-6wfp-jq3r-j9xh](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/security/advisories/GHSA-6wfp-jq3r-j9xh), which affects servers using the local password database, starting MAS 0.20.0 and later. See the advisory for details.

  Full Changelogs:
  * [v1.4.1](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v1.4.1)

  (#813)

## Changed

- Upgrade Postgres Exporter to 0.18.1.

  Full Changelogs:
  - [0.18.0](https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter/releases/tag/v0.18.0)
  - [0.18.1](https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter/releases/tag/v0.18.1)

  (#812)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.10.1 (2025-10-15)

## Added

- List deprecations in `NOTES.txt` when running `helm install`/`helm upgrade`. (#796)
- Support overriding the default `imagePullPolicy` for every component by setting `image.pullPolicy`.

  Per-image overrides can be set by setting `<path.to>.image.pullPolicy` as before.

  If `image.pullPolicy` or per-image overrides aren't set `IfNotPresent` is used by default for images
  referenced by digest and `Always` is used by default images referenced by tag as previously. (#798)

## Changed

- Update Matrix Authentication Service to v1.4.0.

  Highlights:
  * Make it possible to allow password registration without email verification.
  * Add Admin API to finish individual sessions.

  Full Changelogs:
  * [v1.4.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

  (#787)
- Ensure consistent captured headers in HAProxy log lines, between all HTTP request processing HAProxy frontends. (#788)
- Correct the handling of multiple X-Forwarded-For headers to Synapse.

  This may have exhibit itself as requests being incorrectly rate-limited by Synapse.

  The source IP logged by HAProxy is now always the IP connecting to HAProxy rather than
  a value extracted from the X-Forwarded-For header (if present). This is usually an IP
  for the ingress controller. (#788)
- Log the X-Forwarded-For header and stop logging the Referer header in HAProxy. (#788)
- Upgrade HAProxy to 3.2.

  Release notes:
  - [3.2](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/announcing-haproxy-3-2)

  (#790)

  (#793)
- Inform chart users of the deprecations around `rtc.{use_external_ip,node_ip}` that happened in 25.9.1. (#796)
- Move the top-level `imagePullSecrets` list to `image.pullSecrets`.

  Anyone setting `imagePullSecrets` in their values files will see
  schema errors if they don't restructure this setting. (#798)
- Upgrade Synapse to v1.140.0.

  Highlights:
  - Add a new [Media Query by ID Admin API](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/v1.140/admin_api/media_admin_api.html#query-a-piece-of-media-by-id) that allows server admins to query and investigate the metadata of local or cached remote media via the origin/media_id identifier found in a Matrix Content URI
  - Add experimental implementation of the `GET /_matrix/client/v1/rtc/transports` endpoint for the latest draft of [MSC4143: MatrixRTC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4143)

- CI: Use poetry 2.x. (#794)
- CI: handle a user already existing in MAS across subsequent test runs. (#795)
- CI: recreate cached user access tokens when they're not valid (from a previous test run). (#795)
- CI: don't attempt to manage MAS user passwords if password login is disabled. (#795)
- CI: check that user-provided inline configuration changes a hash label on some workloads and thus restarts `Pods`. (#805)

  (#639)
- Split the `receipts-account` worker type into `account-data` and `receipts` workers.

  If you've configured `synapse.workers.receipts-account` this is no longer valid and your configuration should be updated to

- Upgrade Element Web to v1.11.105.

  Highlights:
  * Improvements to the new room list (in labs)
  * Support for custom message components via Module API

  Full Changelog:

  (#575)
- Upgrade Synapse to v1.133.0.

  Highlights:
  * Add support for the [MSC4260 user report API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4260)

  Full Changelog:
  * [v1.133.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.133.0)

  (#577)
- Upgrade Matrix Authentication Service to v0.18.0.

  Full Changelog:
  * [v0.18.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v0.18.0)

  (#578)
- Document how to re-run integration tests from scratch. (#579)
- Better document uninstallation of, and the stores of state managed by the chart. (#585)
- Don't push chart OCI images for every PR. (#589, #591)
- Tweak changelog sections ordering. (#600)

### Fixed

- Fix Matrix RTC SFU `ServiceMonitor` not working. (#569)
- Fix Matrix Authentication Service not using the `hostAliases` set in the values. (#573)
- Fix Matrix RTC Authoriser not having default `hostAliases` values. (#573)
- Fix Postgres and Synapse Media `storageClassName` configuration not being respected.

  **Warning** Previously `synapse.media.storage.storageClass` and `postgres.storage.storageClass`
  were in the values file and associated schema. These values were accidentally silently ignored
  and all chart-managed `PersistentVolumeClaims` were constructed without `spec.storageClassName`
  set, using the cluster default `StorageClass`.

  The values file and associated schema have been updated so that the values are now
  `synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` and `postgres.storage.storageClassName`. The previous
  values are disallowed by the schema. Setting these values after the initial install could 
  cause the `PersistentVolumeClaims` to be recreated, with associated data-loss. Only set
  `synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` or `postgres.storage.storageClassName` on initial
  installation. (#582, #583)

### Removed

- Remove Matrix RTC Authoriser `ServiceMonitor` as the Authoriser has no metrics endpoint. (#569)
- Remove `hostAliases` support from Matrix RTC SFU as it doesn't make outbound requests. (#574)

### Internal

- CI: test that the default values includes stub settings (and thus comments) for various properties. (#573)
- CI: test that `hostAliases` are correctly set for all workloads that make outbound requests. (#573, #574)
- CI: improve the test cluster setup for Matrix RTC. (#579)
- CI: improve testing of chart managed `PersistentVolumeClaims`. (#582)
- CI: test nodeSelectors are appropriately configured. (#583)
