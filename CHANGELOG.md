# ESS Community Helm Chart 26.1.3 (2026-02-04)

## Changed

- Set default permissions on Hookshot so that local users only have permissions to manage integrations and connections.

  Permissions should be adjusted to give specific users the ability to administer integrations, e.g.
  ```yaml
  hookshot:
    additional:
      permissions.yaml:
        config: |
          permissions:
          - actor: {{ $.Values.serverName | quote }}
            services:
            - service: "*"
              level: manageConnections
          - action: "@an-admin-user:{{ $.Values.serverName }}"
            services:
            - service: "*"
              level: admin
  ``` (#1010, #1014)
- Update the test cluster values so that Hookshot can make requests to cluster-internal IP addresses. (#1010, #1018)

## Fixed

- Fix Hookshot widgets not being available when using the Synapse `Ingress` / not having a dedicated Hookshot `Ingress`. (#1010)
- removed haproxy probes
  add haproxy maxconn

## Internal

  Full Changelogs:
  - [v1.146.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.146.0)

  (#992)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 26.1.2 (2026-01-27)

## Added

- Add support for configuring `internalTrafficPolicy` for services behind ingresses. (#999)
- Add support for configuring `externalTrafficPolicy` for `NodePort` and `LoadBalancer` services behind ingresses. (#1000)
- Add support for configuring `externalTrafficPolicy` to `exposedServices`. (#1001)
- Add support for configuring `internalTrafficPolicy` to `exposedServices`. (#1001)
- Add support to customize `nodePort` of exposed services.

  `nodePort` property of `exposedServices.*` is now a string template taking two parameters:
  - `context`: The exposed service values context `*.exposedServices.<svc>`
  - `root` : The helm $ root values context

  On Matrix RTC values, the `nodePort` template defaults to `{{ .context.port }}` so that the `nodePort`
  is the same as `port`. Setting the template to an empty string will skip setting `nodePort`
  on the service.

  (#1002)
- Add support for configuring `externalIPs` of exposed services. (#1006)
- Add support for configuring annotations of Ingress services. (#1007)
- Add support for configuring `externalIPs` of Ingress services. (#1007)

- Build services schema using a common service.json file. (#1003)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 26.1.1 (2026-01-22)

## Removed / Breaking Changes

- Move Synapse's Redis to a top-level shared component that can be used by multiple components of the chart.

  There is no impact when using the default values, but if you have customised values under the `synapse.redis` key, you will need to update them to be under the new top-level `redis` redis. (#972)

  It is not enabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `hookshot.enabled: true`. (#979, #986)
- Matrix RTC: Add support for configuring UDP Turn. (#982)

## Changed

- Support generator arguments in `matrix-tools` secret generation. (#973)
- Support configuring the RSA key size generated by `matrix-tools`. (#973)
- Support exporting RSA key as DER and PEM `matrix-tools`. (#973)
- `matrixRTC.sfu.exposedServices.*.portType` are now an enum, and only accepts `NodePort`, `HostPort` and `LoadBalancer`. (#976)
- Few corrections to the README. (#980)
- Specify service type `ClusterIP` for internal services of Matrix RTC and Synapse. (#985)

## Documentation

# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.12.2 (2025-12-19)

## Security

- Fix critical security issue tracked as `ELEMENTSEC-2025-1670`.

  This release is a critical security update to address an issue affecting all versions of ESS Community and ESS Pro. ESS Classic and other Synapse-based deployments are not affected.

  The issue only has an impact when federation APIs are exposed to an untrusted network. Deployments that are not currently federating, or that only federate in a closed, trusted federation, are not impacted. These deployments should not enable public federation without first applying this update.

  We advise you to apply the update as quickly as possible. (#943)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.12.1 (2025-12-12)

## Removed / Breaking Changes

- The MatrixRTC SFU now restricts creation of calls to users on the local homeserver.

## Changed

- Upgrade Synapse to v1.144.0.

  Highlights:
  - Add experimental implementation of [MSC4380](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4380) (invite blocking).

  Full Changelogs:
  - [v1.8.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v1.8.0)

  (#916)
- Support configuring IPv4-only, IPv6-only or Dual-Stack component binds by configuring `networking.ipFamily`.

  Defaults to `dual-stack` but if you are in a cluster where IPv6 support is either disabled at boot or compiled out you may need to set this to `ipv4` (#921)
- Allow Synapse and Matrix Authentication Service to receive traffic over IPv6. (#921)
- Removed some unused code from the `initSecrets` generation container.

  Also complete the docs on the secret types it supports. (#927)

  (#932)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.12.0 (2025-12-04)

## Removed / Breaking Changes

- Remove `imagePullSecrets` in favour of `image.pullSecrets`.

  As of 25.10.1 `imagePullSecrets` was deprecated in favour of `image.pullSecrets`.
  It has now been removed and attempting to use `imagePullSecrets` will trigger a schema
  validation error. (#901)
- Remove the ability to set `rtc.{use_external_ip,node_ip}` via `matrixRTC.sfu.additional` in favour of `matrixRTC.sfu.{useStunToDiscoverPublicIP,manualIP}`.

  As of 25.9.1 `matrixRTC.sfu.{useStunToDiscoverPublicIP,manualIP}` were introduced to provide direct values for these settings. Attempting to set
  these via `matrixRTC.sfu.additional` will result in your values being ignored. (#901)

## Changed

- Upgrade Element Web to v1.12.6.

  Highlights:
  - Remove mentions from forwarded messages.
  - Improve aria attributes on the emoji picker.
  - Support using Element Call for voice calls in DMs.

  - [v1.12.5](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/releases/tag/v1.12.5)
  - [v1.12.6](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/releases/tag/v1.12.6)

  (#865, #903, #918)
- Remove hard-coded `podAntiAffinity` for `Deployments` that had set `replicas > 2`. (#867)
- Support `topologySpreadConstraints` on all workloads, not just select ones. (#867)
- Set a soft, default `topologySpreadConstraints` for all workloads.

  The can be removed by setting `topologySpreadConstraints` to `[]` at the top-level or
  overridden on a per-component basis by setting that component's `topologySpreadConstraints`. (#867)
- Unify management of `StatefulSet.spec` along with `Deployment.spec`. (#872)
- Upgrade Synapse to v1.143.0.

  Highlights:
  - Update MSC4140 delayed event support, for separate endpoints.

  Full Changelogs:
  - [v1.143.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.143.0)

  (#876)
- Upgrade Matrix Authentication Service to v1.7.0.

  Highlights:
  - Interactively help users choosing a username.

  Full Changelogs:
  - [v1.7.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v1.7.0)

  (#878)
- Change Element Web and MatrixRTC SFU `Ingresses` to target `Service` port names rather than numbers. (#879)
- Harmonise the hook weights and reduce the number of distinct hook weight values.

  This should speed up installs and upgrades as now there are only 2 distinct pre-install/pre-upgrade hook weights. (#880)
- Better handle the only worker-capable delayed-events endpoint. (#889)
- Remove explicit configuration of HAProxy `maxconn` at the global and backend level.

  This improves the compatibility with microk8s clusters that don't raise `ulimits` by default. (#890)
- Upgrade Element Admin to v0.1.9.

  Highlights:
  - Integration with the ESS Pro Adminbot

  Full Changelogs:
  - [v0.1.9](https://github.com/element-hq/element-admin/releases/tag/v0.1.9)

  (#900)
- Listen for HAProxy traffic over IPv6. (#905)
- Change `ipFamilyPolicy` to `PreferDualStack` for all services to expose them over dual-stack where possible. (#907)
- Change Matrix Authentication Service deployment `maxSurge` to 0.

  We have seen migrations race conditions happening during Matrix Authentication Service pods
  rollout. This sets `maxSurge` to 0 to try to make sure only 1 pod at a time runs the
  migration process. (#910, #914)

## Fixed

- Change Postgres `emptyDirs` to be memory backed. (#894)
- Ensure Postgres is fully setup before marking as available or live. (#897)

- CI: Enhance manifests caching in manifests pytest runs. (#899)
- CI: Make cached manifests immutable to avoid issues where they might be mutated during test runs, causing races. (#899)
- CI: stop flakes in `test_pods_monitored`. (#902)
- CI: fix image verifications step failing on PRs on forks. (#909)
- CI: adjust expected status codes to retry on the upgrade integration tests. (#913)

  (#812)


# ESS Community Helm Chart 25.10.1 (2025-10-15)

## Added

- List deprecations in `NOTES.txt` when running `helm install`/`helm upgrade`. (#796)
- Support overriding the default `imagePullPolicy` for every component by setting `image.pullPolicy`.

  Per-image overrides can be set by setting `<path.to>.image.pullPolicy` as before.

  If `image.pullPolicy` or per-image overrides aren't set `IfNotPresent` is used by default for images
  referenced by digest and `Always` is used by default images referenced by tag as previously. (#798)

## Changed

- Update Matrix Authentication Service to v1.4.0.

  Highlights:
  * Make it possible to allow password registration without email verification.
  * Add Admin API to finish individual sessions.

  Full Changelogs:
  * [v1.4.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

  (#787)
- Ensure consistent captured headers in HAProxy log lines, between all HTTP request processing HAProxy frontends. (#788)
- Correct the handling of multiple X-Forwarded-For headers to Synapse.

  This may have exhibit itself as requests being incorrectly rate-limited by Synapse.

  The source IP logged by HAProxy is now always the IP connecting to HAProxy rather than
  a value extracted from the X-Forwarded-For header (if present). This is usually an IP
  for the ingress controller. (#788)
- Log the X-Forwarded-For header and stop logging the Referer header in HAProxy. (#788)
- Upgrade HAProxy to 3.2.

  Release notes:
  - [3.2](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/announcing-haproxy-3-2)

  (#790)
- Upgrade Element Admin to v0.1.4.

  (#793)
- Inform chart users of the deprecations around `rtc.{use_external_ip,node_ip}` that happened in 25.9.1. (#796)
- Move the top-level `imagePullSecrets` list to `image.pullSecrets`.

  Anyone setting `imagePullSecrets` in their values files will see
  schema errors if they don't restructure this setting. (#798)
- Upgrade Synapse to v1.140.0.

  Highlights:
  - Add a new [Media Query by ID Admin API](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/v1.140/admin_api/media_admin_api.html#query-a-piece-of-media-by-id) that allows server admins to query and investigate the metadata of local or cached remote media via the origin/media_id identifier found in a Matrix Content URI

  (#577)
- Upgrade Matrix Authentication Service to v0.18.0.

  Full Changelog:
  * [v0.18.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v0.18.0)

  (#578)
- Document how to re-run integration tests from scratch. (#579)

- Don't push chart OCI images for every PR. (#589, #591)
- Tweak changelog sections ordering. (#600)

### Fixed

- Fix Matrix RTC SFU `ServiceMonitor` not working. (#569)
- Fix Matrix Authentication Service not using the `hostAliases` set in the values. (#573)
- Fix Matrix RTC Authoriser not having default `hostAliases` values. (#573)
- Fix Postgres and Synapse Media `storageClassName` configuration not being respected.

  **Warning** Previously `synapse.media.storage.storageClass` and `postgres.storage.storageClass`
  were in the values file and associated schema. These values were accidentally silently ignored
  and all chart-managed `PersistentVolumeClaims` were constructed without `spec.storageClassName`
  set, using the cluster default `StorageClass`.

  The values file and associated schema have been updated so that the values are now
  `synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` and `postgres.storage.storageClassName`. The previous
  values are disallowed by the schema. Setting these values after the initial install could 
  cause the `PersistentVolumeClaims` to be recreated, with associated data-loss. Only set
  `synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` or `postgres.storage.storageClassName` on initial
  installation. (#582, #583)

### Removed

- Remove Matrix RTC Authoriser `ServiceMonitor` as the Authoriser has no metrics endpoint. (#569)
- Remove `hostAliases` support from Matrix RTC SFU as it doesn't make outbound requests. (#574)

### Internal

- CI: test that the default values includes stub settings (and thus comments) for various properties. (#573)
- CI: test that `hostAliases` are correctly set for all workloads that make outbound requests. (#573, #574)

- Tests: don't check services matching labels against terminating pods. (#595, #598)
- Add `yamllint` ct dependency to poetry.toml. (#596)
- Prepare for 25.7.0 release. (#597)
- CI: run the preview-changelog job on main and manually as well as PRs. (#599)
